<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This repo was created with Next JS, using Typescript. I chose this framework for its excelent Typescript support, optimizations, static file serving and also for its starter template with Chakra UI and Typescript, which I used as a starting point. Chakra UI was my styling choice for its high customization potential, and the utility-based props approach which is inspired by TailwindCSS, making development faster.
